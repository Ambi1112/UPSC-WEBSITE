<h1>Optional subject (two papers)</h1>
Candidates must choose one elective (out of a total of 48 electives). A total of 500 points for 2 works. Choosing the best option theme for your UPSC network should be carefully considered and determined. 

<h1>UPSC mains exam pattern </h1>
The IAS core syllabus is comprehensive, and the questions asked in the CSE require not only some depth of understanding but also the ability to present answers consistently. The UPSC Main Curriculum includes both static and dynamic aspects. It is therefore imperative that IAS candidates track and classify current affairs under appropriate papers/headlines according to the UPSC Core Syllabus. <br> 

The Mains exam has a total of 1750 points (7 tasks x 250 points), and applicants who clear the stage pass the interview (UPSC personality test). The candidate’s interview score (out of 275) is added to UPSC main grades to produce the final recommended candidate merit list. <br>

UPSC’s main exams are designed to test a candidate’s academic expertise and ability to present knowledge consistently. The UPSC Mains exam is designed to assess a candidate’s general intellectual aptitude and conceptual understanding. The main civil service exams serve to test an applicant’s scientific aptitude and ability to present knowledge clearly and coherently.Important points to remember <br>

Indian language and English papers (Paper A and Paper B) are inherently eligible and the grades obtained on these papers do not count towards the ranking. <br> 
Papers in Indian and English (Paper A and Paper B) must be of the admission standards or equivalent. 
Essays, General Studies and Electives will only be considered for candidates who have achieved 25% points in ‘Indian’ and 25% in ‘English’ as ​​the minimum eligibility criteria for these qualification papers.  <br>
Only grades given to candidates for papers I-VII count toward the merit ranking. 
The assignment sheets for this exam are traditional (short essay), 3 hours each. 
Candidates have the option to answer all questionnaires, except for the qualifying language papers, Paper A and Paper B, in any of the languages ​​listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India or English.  <br>
Questionnaires (excluding literature on language courses) are written in Hindi and English only. 
For blind volunteers and volunteers with motor impairment and cerebral palsy, 20 minutes per hour if the dominant (writing) limb is impaired to the extent that performance is impaired (minimum 40% impairment). compensation time is allowed. Civil Service Preliminary Examination and Civil Service Final Examination. <br>
Completing a UPSC Mains dissertation is a major challenge in itself and many applicants fail to complete their thesis due to poor time management in the lab.  <br>
 Candidates should therefore start writing their answers before the exam in order to practice and plan their time management. 
Usually, you need to build up some basic knowledge before you start writing your answer. Candidates can then look at UPSC papers from the previous year to learn the types of questions that will be asked on the main exam. 3-4 months before the 
 UPSC Mains Exam, candidates can start their Answer Writing exercises. Response writing skills can be instilled even if the candidate is struggling and lacks confidence at first. <br>
Some things to remember while writing the mains answer <br>

Your response should impress reviewers and give the impression that the response was written by a future administrator. <br> 
Your answer should answer the question asked in a concise, clear, orderly, descriptive, and beautiful way. Another important point is that examiners expect to different answers for electives and majors.  <br>
Electives expect candidates to have a thorough understanding of concepts. This is a “selected” subject and your answers should reflect that understanding.  <br>
Learn more about the best UPSC options here. However, the GS thesis requires candidates to have a good (but not necessarily deep) understanding of concepts that can be presented multi-dimensionally. This means, for example, that questions from the field of international relations should be answered within that field itself, but that candidates can apply it to fields such as state and governance, social affairs, and homeland security. Help when you can. And so on, extrapolating and so on.  <br>
Leading questions generally contain specific key phrases called “directives” that provide clues as to how to answer them.
Presentation: Responses must be written in clear, legible handwriting. Include headings and subheadings as needed. If it improves the quality of your response, please also provide tables and figures.  <br>
Simple language: Always write in the simple, error-free language. Writing should be clear, complete and concise. Avoid jargon and flower language. Ambiguity in answers and lower grades is possible.  <br>
Periods or paragraphs: Many applicants have the question of whether to write with periods or paragraphs. There are no rules to follow here. It depends on your comfort level and what you are comfortable with. If you feel you can write better in dots, keep doing it. If you like to express yourself in paragraphs, you should follow this convention. Adhere to the number of characters specified by UPSC.  <br>
Practice: This is the most important tip one can give. Practice writing many answers in all subjects as part of your preparation for the IAS Main. Follow our comprehensive news analysis daily. There are two main exercises provided. Please post your answers in the comments section of the page. <br>
